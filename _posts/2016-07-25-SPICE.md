### Abstract
There is considerable interest in the task of automatically generating image captions. However, evaluation is challenging. Existing automatic evaluation metrics are primarily sensitive to n-gram overlap, which is neither necessary nor sufficient for the task of simulating human judgment. In this paper we hypothesize that semantic propositional content is an important component of human caption evaluation, and propose a new automated caption evaluation metric defined over scene graphs coined *SPICE*. Evaluations indicate that SPICE captures human judgments over model-generated captions better than other automatic metrics (e.g., system-level correlation of 0.88 with human judgments on the MS COCO dataset, versus 0.43 for CIDEr and 0.53 for METEOR). Furthermore, SPICE can answer questions such as *which caption-generator best understands colors?* and *can caption-generators count?*

### Code

SPICE can be downloaded via the link below. This will download a 31 MB zip file containing (1) the SPICE code jar, (2) the libraries required to run SPICE (except for Stanford CoreNLP) and (3) documentation / source code for the project. Unzip this file, download Stanford CoreNLP using the included download script and you’re ready to use it.
